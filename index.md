I'm a robotics engineer living in Montreal. In my downtime I am an avid tourist, tech enthusiast, and wanna-be photographer.

I recently graduated from McGill. During my time at there, I interned at Bombardier and Suncor, did research at [SWPG](https://mcgill.ca/mecheng/researchlabs/swpg), and played in [McGill Fight Band](http://www.mcgillathletics.ca/sports/2012/12/6/GEN_1206121625.aspx). I also helped found [FRC Team 4955 LA Tech](http://www.frc4955.com) and served as the lead coordinator.

I have just started to work at [Pleiades Robotics](http://pleiades.ca).
