### Software Developer at Pleiades Robotics

Since August 2015, I've been writing code for Spiri, a next generation quadcopter by
Pleiades Robotics. It's still a small company, so a given day can find me debugging driver
code, test flying our robot, fighting with the on-board networking tools,
writing ROS modules, or making unit tests for our system.

The team I'm working with is small but very hard working. In just three months we went
from a conceptual design to a flying prototype. Check out some of the code we open sourced, at
[my github](https://github.com/ssoRL/spiri_go).

### Software Developer at Computing Music

During the Summer of 2013, and again after graduating in 2014, I was the lead (usually only)
software developer for the Computing Music Web App. I made everything for the app from the
bottom up during this time.

The apps backend was written in ocaml. This was a design choice made larely in order to easily
interface with the rest of the computing music library, and despite some complexity in the
setup, it's worked quite well. Ocaml is of course a type-safe and fast language, and its
functional nature lends it well to generating the large json structures used to communicate
with the frontend.

The front end started as a few javascript files. And then became a few more javascript files.
And then a few more. Now it's all in typescipt, which I find really helps the organization. This
is by far the most complicated part of the app, including windows to display sheet music
and markings on it, as well as a fully functional command line to pass intensive work loads
off to the server in Computing Music's own meta-language.

I'm still doing some work with Computing Music part time. At the moment trying to build a new
ui framework in React. React looks really cool.

### Internship at Ubisense

During the Summer of 2012 I worked at [Ubisense](http://ubisense.net/en) in Camden Maine.
During my time there, I was involved in tracking down and fixing bugs that clients in the
field ran across, and also creating a test procedure to manually check the UI from the ground
up when we were ready to release a new build

### Volunteering at Walksafe

Walksafe was a McGill Student service dedicated to making sure that everyone had someone to walk
home with at night if they needed it. As an executive, I was in charge of managing our teams of
volunteers, and as the Website Manager, I was in charge of bringing Walksafe's website up to
date.

On top of significant design changes I made in conjuction with our PR Executive, I also
overhauled the mySQL database to better represent the way that we managed our volunteers at
the time, and wrote an algorithm to handle the scheduling of volunteers. Scheduling was a task
that had previously taken one of the executives several hours a month, working out all of the
conflicts and dependencies. That time was reduced to the click of a button.
