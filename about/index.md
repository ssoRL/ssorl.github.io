I grew up on the Midcoast of Maine, sailing, hiking, and learning how to use chainsaws, for the first eighteen years of my life. I was then drawn to Montreal, Quebec to study at McGill University, eventually graduating fours years later with a degree in Computer Science. Since then I've been working with two start ups: Computing Music, and Pleiades Robotics, where I've had the pleasure to be working on the cutting edge in the development of autonomous machines.
