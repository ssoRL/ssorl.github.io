You want to read the crazy stuff I wrote? Cool! Most of it's still trapped somewhere on my hard drive, waiting for the day when it's file format becomes unreadable and I'm forced to throw it out. But [here's](https://salemhunters.wordpress.com/archives/) a novel I actually finished a few years back, and [here's](https://travelingwithvictoria.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/the-chronicles-of-sarnia/) an (often) true account of my experience driving across the United States.
